# Analysis-of-Text-Data-
This project is a text analysis from two books: Scrum Handbook and Agile Processes in Software Engineering .  Python's re library for regular expression and Python's NLTK library were used to clean and manipulate the text, while Python's Matplotlib was used to construct the visualisations.
